# Amazon UI Clone

A UI clone of the Amazon website built for learning and portfolio purposes. This repository focuses on recreating the visual layout, navigation, product listing, product detail views, cart behavior, and checkout UI (no production payment processing by default). Replace or extend features as needed.

## Demo / Screenshots
- Add screenshots to `/docs` or `/assets/screenshots` and reference them here.
- Live demo: (add your deployed URL here, e.g. Vercel / Netlify)

## Features
- Responsive header with search and account/cart actions
- Home / product listing grid
- Product detail modal or page with image, title, price, rating
- Add to cart and cart summary (front-end state)
- Checkout UI flow (mock or integrated with Stripe — optional)
- User authentication (mock or Firebase Auth — optional)
- Mobile-first responsive CSS (Flexbox / Grid)
- Accessible components where possible

## Tech stack (example)
- React (create-react-app / Vite)
- CSS / SASS / Tailwind / Styled Components (replace with your choice)
- State management: Context API or Redux
- Optional: Firebase (Auth & Firestore), Stripe (payments)
- Build / deploy: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages

## Project structure (example)
- public/ — static assets
- src/
  - components/ — shared UI components (Header, ProductCard, Cart, Footer)
  - pages/ — Home, Product, Checkout, Orders
  - styles/ — global and component styles
  - firebase.js — Firebase config (if used)
  - App.jsx / index.jsx

## Setup (Windows)
1. Clone the repo
   - Open PowerShell in your projects folder:
     ```
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd "e:\VS CODE\Projects\Web Dev Projects\Amazon clone"
     ```
2. Install dependencies
   - Using npm:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Or using Yarn:
     ```
     yarn
     ```
3. Create environment variables (if needed)
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add keys, e.g.:
     ```
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
     REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
     ```
   - Restart the dev server after changing env vars.

4. Run locally
   - npm:
     ```
     npm run start
     ```
   - yarn:
     ```
     yarn start
     ```
   - Open http://localhost:3000 (or console-specified port)

## Common scripts (package.json)
- npm run start — start dev server
- npm run build — create production build
- npm run test — run tests (if present)
- npm run lint — run linter (if configured)

## Deploy
- Vercel / Netlify: connect the GitHub repo, set environment variables, set build command (`npm run build`) and publish directory (`build` or `dist`).
- GitHub Pages: use `gh-pages` package or deploy build artifacts manually.

## Notes on data & payments
- If using Firebase: secure your rules and never commit private keys. Use environment vars.
- If using Stripe for real payments: use server-side endpoints for secret keys. Avoid exposing secret keys in the client.

## How to document your specific project
1. Replace the Tech stack section with actual frameworks/libraries you used.
2. Add a short architecture paragraph describing how state flows (e.g., Redux store shape or Context providers).
3. Add code snippets showing how to run major components or how to add a product.
4. Include at least 3 screenshots (desktop, tablet, mobile) and a short demo GIF.

## Contributing
- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, submit a PR with a clear description.
- Keep commits focused and add tests where applicable.

## License
- Add or choose a license (MIT recommended). Example:
  ```
  MIT License
  ```

## Contact
- Add your name, email, or portfolio link here.
